title: Balancing Act
---
Seems like start-ups are just a set of balancing acts. Trying to balance costs, prices, promotions, marketing, development, and million other different spinning plates.

My most recent balancing act seems to be testing versus releasing. When working at Adobe, we had the luxury of a team of people who could do lots of things, and were very good at what they did. And one of the best things we had was user testing, which I've studied a bit myself, that enabled us to create the best possible product we could. But, working as just me, I have to split my time between a bunch of different things, and as much as I'd love to test the heck out of all of my products, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to. I don't have enough time to do it quickly, or enough money to spend a lot of time on it. I think this may be one lesson I may need to unlearn a little bit for now, and go with the quicker approach. I've got testing, and development, and marketing, and support, and a hundred other tasks calling for me, and I can't let good products sit on the shelf because I have run a full user test on it.

Maybe if I had another set of hands, but I'm a one man show for now. Basically, this is all an excuse for why I can't spend the time on the UX. But I feel I've got to do some. Still got to learn to balance this plate, cause I may be dropping others.
