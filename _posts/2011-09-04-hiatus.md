title: Hiatus

While it may seem that I have already been on hiatus as of late, I will actually be going on hiatus for the next few weeks. I will be traveling a bit over the next few weeks and will not be doing my weekly projects. During this time, I will be online sporadically, and will answer e-mails, questions and concerns about anything as I can.
