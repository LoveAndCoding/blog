title: Cleaning Up

Well, this blog is old and has a lot of cruft. Really, my whole site is way past its expiration date. It's been needing a redesign for years now, but I just haven't had the time. Well, now I'm making the time. New homepage, and a new blog. Let's try this again, shall we.

Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm a developer, a creative type (sometimes), a gamer, and an all around nerd. I've got my own start-up going at the moment over at [Widgets.Mu](https://widgets.mu) and I'll probably be talking about that a bit on here. The rest of it will likely be coding, random projects, and any other thoughts I feel like sharing. I'm pretty random, so my blog is probably going to follow suit.
