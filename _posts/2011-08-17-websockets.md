title: Websockets

A new version of Firefox means new features, and as much as I hate their new release schedule it does offer me the chance to get new things to play with sooner. Like the new Websockets API, which was removed from previous versions. Now that I have that to play around with, I've got a few fun projects in mind to utilize it.

Also, don't think that I've forgotten, or even neglected, my projects. I've been tinkering away and hope to complete one of things I've been developing for a couple weeks now hopefully on or before my release this week. That said, it is going to depend on a few things, but you should see the results of it, it just may not be right on time.

Keep checking back for some exciting new projects, including some ones using some brand new toys.
