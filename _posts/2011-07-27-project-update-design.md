title: Project Update - Design
---
So, I realize I missed my usual midnight on Sunday deadline. That was actually because this week I was out of town for a few days, and actually just got back. So, this is the update for this week. I've entered into the design phase, getting the look and feel down for the project, but I'm not sure I quite like it yet. It still seems a little rough around the edges, and doesn't quite fit the way I think it should look, so I'll likely be continuing in the design phase going forward. They say you have to design something wrong to know how to design something right. I will continue to play around with the design until I can get something that I think fits better.

In the meantime, I will likely being doing a bit of a hiatus starting this week for this particular project and switch over to something else. This will hopefully give me some new eyes when I get back, and will get me an opportunity to play around with some things I've just gotten. I'm sure I will return to this particular project shortly though.
